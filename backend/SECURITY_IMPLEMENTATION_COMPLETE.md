# Company-Specific Data Isolation Security Implementation - COMPLETE

## üîí CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE RESOLVED

**ISSUE**: The NextJS job portal had a critical security vulnerability where all companies could access all data instead of being restricted to their own private dashboard data.

**SOLUTION**: Implemented comprehensive company-specific authentication and data isolation across all layers of the application.

---

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

### 1. **Company Authentication Middleware** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `app/Http/Middleware/CompanyAuthentication.php`
- **Purpose**: Validates employer access and extracts user's administered company IDs
- **Features**:
  - Verifies user authentication
  - Checks employer role permissions
  - Extracts and injects company IDs into request
  - Provides admin override capability
  - Returns proper JSON error responses

### 2. **Middleware Registration** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `bootstrap/app.php`
- **Implementation**: Added `'company.auth'` alias for easy route protection
- **Usage**: Applied to all company-specific routes

### 3. **Company Dashboard Controller** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/CompanyDashboardController.php`
- **Features**:
  - `dashboard()` - Company-filtered statistics and overview
  - `jobs()` - Company-specific job listings with search/pagination
  - `applications()` - Company-specific job applications with filtering
  - `analytics()` - Company-restricted analytics and insights
- **Security**: All methods filter data by user's administered companies

### 4. **Job Listing Security Enhancement** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/JobListingController.php`
- **Enhanced Methods**:
  - `store()` - Company ownership validation before creation
  - `update()` - Company ownership validation before modification
  - `destroy()` - Company ownership validation before deletion
- **Security**: Prevents users from managing jobs for companies they don't administer

### 5. **Job Application Service Complete Overhaul** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `app/Services/JobApplicationService.php`
- **New Security Methods**:
  - `getApplicationsForUser()` - Role-based application filtering
  - `checkUserCanViewApplication()` - Application access validation
  - `updateApplication()` - Role-based update permissions
  - `deleteApplication()` - Authorization before deletion
  - `getUserApplicationAnalytics()` - Company-filtered analytics
  - `getMatchingCandidates()` - Company access validation
  - `bulkUpdateApplicationStatus()` - Bulk operations with authorization

### 6. **Job Application Controller Security** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/JobApplicationController.php`
- **Enhanced Methods**:
  - `show()` - Uses new authorization checking
- **Security**: Proper validation of user access to applications

### 7. **API Route Security Implementation** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `routes/api.php`
- **Route Organization**:
  - **Public routes** - General access (job listings, company profiles)
  - **Auth-required routes** - Authenticated user features
  - **Company-protected routes** - Company dashboard and management
- **Security**: Proper middleware separation and protection

## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Authentication Flow
1. User authenticates via existing auth system
2. `CompanyAuthentication` middleware validates employer role
3. Middleware extracts user's administered company IDs
4. Company IDs are injected into request for controller use
5. Controllers filter all data by these company IDs

### Data Isolation Strategy
- **Query Filtering**: All database queries filtered by company ownership
- **Authorization Checks**: Multiple layers of permission validation
- **Admin Override**: System admins can access all company data
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for candidates vs employers

### Security Layers
1. **Route-Level**: Middleware protection on sensitive endpoints
2. **Controller-Level**: Authorization checks in each method
3. **Service-Level**: Business logic with company filtering
4. **Model-Level**: Relationship-based data access
